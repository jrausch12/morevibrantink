<h1>More Vibrant Ink</h1>


I have always loved the base Vibrant Ink included with RStudio 1.2 but I thought it could use a bit of _flair_. This theme is also friendly with the line highlight option found under `Tools>Global Options>Code>Display` called `Highlight selected line`, which I find particularly helpful in a dark theme when debugging code.

<h1>Installation</h1>
Make sure you're running RStudio 1.2 or later
Run this:
```rstudioapi::addTheme("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrausch12/morevibrantink/master/more_vibrant_ink.rstheme", TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)```
The above line will pull my theme down into your theme folder and override globally whatever theme you're currently using. Can be changed at any time by going to `Tools > Global Options > Appearance`
